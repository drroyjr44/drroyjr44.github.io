Figures: Elevator User Interface from an Apartment Elevator consisting of 4 floors.

In this current design of the user interface of the elevator, there are 2 columns and 6 rows of user buttons and technician controls. The top 4 rows consist of the most important and frequently used controls – the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th floor; the elevator door-open and door-close button, and the emergency alarm button. This is a good user-friendly interface with a minimalistic design so that the users can easily and quickly understand the interface and make use of the elevator. There is clear numeric digit beside each floor buttons to make sure the user can understand the functionality of the buttons and can quickly select the floor they need to go. The open and close door button also come with a clearly understandable icons, where <|> indicates the door opening outwards, and the >|< means the door closing inwards from both sides. There is a CALL button on the 5th row and 1st column, with a telephone icon which indicates the user to press the call button in case the user needs assistance. Furthermore, there is also a Bell button on the 4th row 5th column which the user can press during cases of emergency such as elevator breakdown or fire. 

There are some problems, in my opinion, with the UI of the elevator. For instance, the LED screen is located at the top which shows the floor number the user is currently on, but it is located around 9 feet or more from the level of the ground, so users with an average height can easily ignore the LED panel or must look up and stress their neck to look at the LED. Since the apartment has only 4 floors, it would also be easier if the floor buttons were stacked on top of each other in one column, since there is also enough space to have the buttons placed like that. This would be it easier for the user to get used to the position of the buttons, because with the current design, where the floor button 1 and 2 in placed in one row and 3 and 4 in the row above, the user can easily get confused in understanding the chronological order of the floor buttons. For example, the user might think 2nd floor button is on top of floor button 1, but instead it is on the right side of it. Additionally, I think it is not necessary for the technical buttons to be the at the bottom or at the same level as the other more frequently used user buttons. This is because users have no use of the technical buttons, and they hardly ever make use of it. So, in my opinion, the technical buttons should be placed separately from the section of the more used buttons, like above all the other buttons or at the same level as the LED panel.

When a user gets inside an elevator, the regular sequence of actions is the user looking at the elevator control interface, pressing the button of the floor they want to go, then pressing the door close button, but the user can also choose to press the door-open button if another person is trying to get inside the elevator while the door is closing. Hence, the most frequent interactions the user is going to have with the interface is the floor buttons, door-open and door-close buttons. The user may also have to interact with the call button if there is a problem with the elevator or any other potential assistance, and also the emergency alarm / bell button if there is a fire or any danger inside of the elevator. For the most part, this elevator has a minimalistic design which helps users get used to the position of the buttons, and the LED which shows the users what floor they are currently on. I would just redesign the interface in a way which separates the technical buttons from the most used user buttons, and then reposition the floor button in one column so that users can easily recognize the floor buttons as they are stacked on top of each other. I would also, color code the alarm and call button differently than the floor buttons which help users visually even more in differentiating between different kinds of buttons. I would reposition the LED panel right on top of the top floor button just so it is in a convenient position for users with average and short height to look at and they don’t have to stress their neck to look up to the LED panel.
